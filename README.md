### Regression-Insurance-Dataset
This is a machine learning project competition Machine learning.  This is to predict if a client at a bank will leave the bank or not. We were given a task to predict the top 3 winners of a race. We were then given the information of that race to use for the next race. 

We were given 30 races in the beginning to train our model and to predict.
